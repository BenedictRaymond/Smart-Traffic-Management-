# Smart-Traffic-Management-
This project creates an AI-driven traffic management system that optimizes traffic light timings based on real-time vehicle data. It features emergency vehicle alerts, traffic warnings, map integration, and driver behavior monitoring to enhance traffic flow, reduce congestion, and promote urban sustainability.

## Features
- **Real-Time Vehicle Detection**: Capture and track vehicles, including types and speeds, using CCTV feeds.
- **Emergency Vehicle Alerts**: Prioritize traffic lights for emergency vehicles detected by sirens.
- **Traffic Warnings**: Blinking signals indicate heavy traffic at upcoming intersections.
- **Map Integration**: Display real-time traffic data on interactive mobile maps.
- **Driver Behavior Monitoring**: Implement a point-based system for traffic violations and insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: OpenCV, YOLO for object detection
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Hardware**: Arduino for LED integration

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
